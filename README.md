Brain Tumor Detection
Overview
This project aims to develop a system for detecting brain tumors in medical images using machine learning techniques. 
The system processes MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans of the brain to identify the presence of tumors.
Brain tumors are a serious medical condition that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment.
Automated detection systems can assist healthcare professionals in accurately identifying tumors from medical images,
leading to early intervention and improved patient outcomes.
